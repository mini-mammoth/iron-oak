# Iron Oak

This mod aims to add several ore infused oak trees. This allows you to plant and farm ingot instead of mining them in
the dark.

## Processing

To create your first *iron infused oak sapling* you have to create *iron infused bone meal*.

**Crafting: Iron Infused Bone Meal**

```
  BBB
  BIB -> 8x Iron Infused Bone Meal 
  BBB
  
  B = Bone Meal
  I = Raw Iron
```

Apply this to any oak sapling to magically infuse the sapling. (This will not always work)

Once the sapling is infused, you will see it grow into an *iron infused oak*. Cutting this tree will give you *iron
infused logs* which can be processed into ingot. But be careful if you cut this logs into planks all sparks of iron ore
getting lost.

Next you have to craft a *fire bowl*. This allows you to safely burn the logs and collect the ashes. Burning *iron
infused logs* inside a fire bowl will produce *iron infused ash*.

**Crafting: Fire Bowl**

```
  I I
  IXI -> Fire Bowl
  IBI
  
  I = Iron Ingot
  X = Iron Bars
  B = Bucket
```

Now you can use a *cauldron* to wash the *iron infused ash* and get *iron shreds*. Once you have collected 9 shreds you
can craft a *raw iron*.
